# üé¨ My Personal Media Server ‚Äì Jellyfin + Tailscale on macOS

I built a secure, self-hosted media streaming server using [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), all running from my macOS machine. Now I can stream movies, TV shows, and music from anywhere ‚Äî without subscriptions, ads, or exposing anything to the public internet.

---

## üìå Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, private way to enjoy my media on all my devices ‚Äî at home or on the go. With this setup, everything stays under my control: no third parties, no data collection, just me and my content.

## üöÄ How I Set It Up

### ‚úÖ 1. Installed Jellyfin on macOS

I downloaded the `.pkg` installer from [jellyfin.org/downloads](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/), installed it like any other app, and launched the server.


![Jellyfin UI](/images/e0a87856b69877660cb539a2a69dc60452aecc124bfc97116133877b45c2701e.png)

I accessed it from my local browser at:

http://localhost:8096

Here‚Äôs what it looked like once it was up and running:

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Set Up My Media Library

I organized my files into folders like:

~/Media/Movies
~/Media/TV

Then, in the Jellyfin dashboard, I went to **Dashboard ‚Üí Libraries ‚Üí Add Media Library** and linked those folders.

Here's the library setup in action:

### ‚úÖ 3. Installed Tailscale for Secure Remote Access

I installed Tailscale from [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download), logged in with my account, and added my Mac as a device in my private mesh network.

![Download UI](/images/e0be22e05f3a8f8af4bdf7b10af2b8ab95c66e0709d5add0cec678fa904f633d.png)

Once it connected, I grabbed the Tailscale IP from the app:

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Accessed My Server Remotely

From any of my other devices (with Tailscale installed), I could now connect to:

http://100.x.x.x:8096

To make it even cleaner, I enabled MagicDNS and used:

http://your-mac-hostname.ts.net:8096

### üåê Access Points

| Location        | URL                                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Localhost       | `http://localhost:8096`            |
| Same Network    | `http://<your-local-ip>:8096`      |
| Remote (VPN)    | `http://100.x.x.x:8096`            |
| MagicDNS (opt.) | `http://your-mac-hostname.ts.net`  |

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

| Task                                 | Status |
|--------------------------------------|--------|
| Jellyfin accessible locally          | ‚úÖ     |
| Libraries created and scanned        | ‚úÖ     |

| Streaming from mobile & smart TV     | ‚úÖ     |
| MagicDNS for cleaner URL (optional)  | ‚úÖ / ‚ùå  |

---

## üîê Why It‚Äôs Secure

- No open ports or public IPs  
- All traffic routed through encrypted WireGuard tunnels (Tailscale)  
- Jellyfin uses user authentication  
- Tailscale ACLs restrict which devices can reach the server
